## Developing an AI based command line application to implement an image classifier to predict flower

### This is the second project under my UDACITY AI Programming with Python Nanodegree [ received as scholarship via AWS DeepRacer Student League 2022 ]
[Link to the program](https://learn.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd089)

In this project, I have first developed the code for an image classifier built using PyTorch [see Image Classifier Project.ipynb]. Then I have developed it into a Command Line Python application that can train an image classifier on a dataset [see train.py], and then finally predict new images using the trained model [see predict.py].

The dataset used for training, validation and testing the model can found [in this link](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html). The dataset consists of 102 flower categories. The flowers chosen are commonly found in the United Kingdom. Each class consists of about 40 to 258 images.
